# Spacing & Layout

Our layout and spacing system is designed for comfort, clarity, and inclusivity. We use a simple, consistent spacing scale and a flexible grid to ensure content is easy to read and interact with for everyone.

**Spacing Scale:**
- Uses a 4px base for consistency and comfort
- Responsive adjustments for all device sizes

**Grid System:**
- Mobile-first, single-column by default
- Expands to multi-column layouts on larger screens
- Generous padding and margins for a welcoming feel

**Guidelines:**
- Avoid crowding elements
- Use whitespace to create a relaxed, approachable interface
- Ensure layouts adapt smoothly to all screen sizes
